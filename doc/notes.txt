Poker App

The project was developed in Ruby ob Rails, it still has some problems.

Which are:
Still missing to validate the ties between some plays, trio, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush and royal flush.

I did the project very structured, I would like to improve it.


The application I upload to heroku and can try it on:

The application has two buttons:

New Deck:
Restart the deck session.

New hand:
Deal 2 hands more, saying at once the winning hand.

If the deck is left without cards, it warns.
Or if the session expires he notifies.
