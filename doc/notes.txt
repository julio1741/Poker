Poker App

The project was developed in Ruby ob Rails, it still has some problems.

Which are:
Still missing to validate the ties between some plays, trio, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush and royal flush.

I did the project very structured, I would like to improve it.

The repository is available in:

The application I upload to heroku and can try it on:
